# Current state

## Phase

M1 — Sovereign Devnet Alpha. Protocol primitives and ledger-transition v1 are
accepted, and the reproducible toolchain executes their cross-language
vectors.

## Verified facts

- Repository: `kaikisegfault/protocol-stack`.
- F0 merged to `main` through PR #3 on 2026-07-23.
- The reproducible build/toolchain slice merged through PR #7 on 2026-07-23;
  all four GitHub compiler/sanitizer jobs passed.
- Ledger-transition v1 merged through PR #9 on 2026-07-23; all four GitHub
  compiler/sanitizer jobs passed.
- On 2026-07-23 the owner granted standing authority for autonomous project
  decisions and repository operations. A `proceed` instruction requires no
  follow-up approval.
- `.codex/config.toml` selects `gpt-5.6-sol` with extra-high (`xhigh`)
  reasoning.
- ADR 0004 accepts PureEdDSA Ed25519, SHA-256 with explicit domain separation,
  fixed-width big-endian PSCE, 32-byte account IDs with Bech32m text addresses,
  and RFC 9162-style ordered Merkle trees for M1.
- ADR 0005 pins CMake 4.4.0, Ninja 1.13.0, and libsodium 1.0.22 with exact
  SHA-256 integrity checks. The supported bootstrap is Linux x86_64.
- Strict signature acceptance requires libsodium-compatible canonical and
  small-order rejection. OpenSSL 3.0.20 alone accepted the adversarial
  identity-key vector and is not a valid consensus verifier.
- `tools/verify.sh` is the clean-clone entry point. It isolates build tools in
  an ignored virtual environment, builds the pinned libsodium source, and runs
  C++ and standard-library-only Python checks through CTest.
- ADR 0006 and `ledger-transition-v1.md` define canonical genesis, a
  single-native-asset transfer, fixed fee-pool routing, exact nonce/expiry and
  failure rules, receipts, and ordered atomic block execution.
- The M1 devnet uses nine atomic decimal places, a `10^18` atomic supply limit,
  a default `10^17` atomic four-account genesis, a 1,000-atomic fixed fee, and
  no post-genesis issuance.
- The issue #8 in-memory kernel branch implements strict transaction admission
  and checked transfer execution. It does not yet implement genesis loading,
  commitments, ordered block commit, persistence, networking, or deployment.

## Verification evidence

- The fixed primitive vector suite passes through `tools/verify.sh` with GCC
  12.2.0, Clang 14.0.6, and `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror`.
- Both GCC and Clang AddressSanitizer plus UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer presets
  pass.
- Vectors cover RFC 8032 interoperability, domain separation, transaction
  bytes and identifiers, Bech32m, state and transaction roots, mutation,
  malformed length, checksum, non-canonical scalar, small-order, supply-bound,
  conservation, and ordering rejection.
- CMake preset JSON, TOML, GitHub workflow and issue-form YAML, Python bytecode
  compilation, shell syntax, internal Markdown links, and `git diff --check`
  pass.
- The independent C++20 and Python ledger decision harnesses reproduce a
  canonical genesis, chain ID, 11 admitted transaction results, three
  admission error classes plus unknown-kind rejection, ordered receipts,
  recipient creation, fee routing, final accounts, transaction/state roots,
  application header, and block ID.
- Ledger vectors cover success, replay, self-transfer, zero amount, low fee
  limit, expiry, absent sender, nonce mismatch and exhaustion, debit overflow,
  insufficient balance, malformed bytes, wrong chain, invalid signature, and
  unauthorized transaction kind.
- All four local presets pass 4/4 CTest tests: GCC, GCC ASan+UBSan, Clang, and
  Clang ASan+UBSan.
- The initial production kernel slice uses owned value types, exact canonical
  shape and chain checks, domain-separated account/transaction IDs, and the
  pinned strict libsodium adapter. Its frozen admission vectors pass 5/5 CTest
  tests under all four local presets.
- Checked production transfer execution reproduces all nine result codes and
  the 11 admitted frozen-vector receipts. Tests establish fee routing,
  conservation after every accepted transition, self-transfer, recipient
  creation, nonce exhaustion, and byte-equivalent state atomicity for ordinary
  failures and checked recipient/fee-pool invariant failures.
- All four local presets pass 6/6 CTest tests with the transfer execution
  slice: GCC, GCC ASan+UBSan, Clang, and Clang ASan+UBSan.
- The execution slice adds no raw-byte entry point; fuzzing remains required
  when the variable-length production genesis decoder is introduced.

## Exact next action

Continue issue #8:

> Reconcile the generic 1,048,576-byte canonical-object limit with the ledger
> genesis account-count bound and clarify signature-canonicality admission
> errors in the accepted specification. Then implement production genesis
> loading and commitments plus a public state owner that encapsulates immutable
> parameters, enforces the exact next height, and atomically commits ordered
> block results against the frozen vectors before fuzz/property and 10,000
> seeded differential sequences.

## Open autonomous decisions

- Final acceptance of CometBFT as the replaceable M1 consensus/P2P adapter.

## Blockers

None.
